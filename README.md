# Health Innovation Lab

### Background
Taking place at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA) in February 2016, the Health Innovation Lab aimed to teach practical data skills whilst trying to tackle Type 2 Diabetes in Leeds.

The data revolution is undoubtedly making waves in healthcare. Innovations in open data, wearable technology, big data and analytics have the potential to save lives. As students, you can be a part of these changes.
Dr. Kirk D. Borne, Data Scientist:
> "The application of analytics for discovery, decision support, and benefits in healthcare has the potential to radically improve health maintenance, treatments, diagnoses and outcomes in personalised medicine, personal health and population health."

However, while a lot of students would like to be a part of these innovations, access to these kinds of skills is not available to most students. Our Health Innovation Lab aims to change that by providing students with the opportunity to learn data skills whilst working on health problems, specifically health inequalities and Type 2 Diabetes in Yorkshire. 
Data science skills are hugely in demand with employers but difficult to acquire for the majority of students. Employers need to fill the huge skills gap but graduates do not have the skills to take these positions. Student Data Labs addresses these new developments by helping university students learn practical data skills on real-world problems. We also aim to develop interpersonal skills such as team-working and connect students with local businesses who may be interested in hiring them upon graduation.

### Data & Resources
Student Data Labs has compiled learning resources and open data sets that focus on Type 2 Diabetes and health inequalities in Leeds.

### Student Data Labs
Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle Type 2 Diabetes and health inequalities in Leeds. Student Data Labs works with an interdisciplinary team of students, data scientists, designers, researchers and software developers. We also aim to connect our Data Lab Volunteers with local employers who may be interested in employing them upon graduation.
